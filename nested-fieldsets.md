# Nested fieldset

It is possible to nest a fieldset inside another fieldset. Although it is valid markup, screen readers do not automatically indicate the end of a fieldset which can make if difficult for users to confidently know which fields belong to which fieldset.

### Description

**Issue:** Nested fieldsets

**Page:**

**URL:** 

**Description:** This page contains one or more fieldsets that are nested inside another fieldset. Although this is valid markup, screen readers do not automatically indicate the end of a fieldset which can make if difficult for users to confidently know which fields belong to which fieldset.

**Resolve:** Structure the questions on the page in such a way that nested is not required, if the page is complex then consider spilting the page into multiple smaller, less complex, pages.
