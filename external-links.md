# External links

An external link is a link that takes the user away from the current website or journey by opening the destination in a new tab.

It's beneficial for users to know that a new tab will open as it helps prevent disorientation, especially for users of assistive technology.

This is not a WCAG fail, but consistant navigation does benefit all users and may prevent frustration for some users.

## Audit template

### Description

**Issue:** Missing â€˜opens in new tabâ€™ as part of the link

**Page:**

**URL:** 

**Description:** External links should contain text informing the user that they will be taken to a new browser tab. This will help assistive technology users understand the result of the action and help prevent them possibly getting disorientated when the browser back button is unavailable.

**Resolve:** Add â€˜opens in new tabâ€™ as part of the visible link which opens in the new tab. The text should be part of the link to make it easily identifiable for all users as well as being announced as part of the link for assistive technology users.
