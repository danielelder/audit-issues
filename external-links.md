# External links

An external link is a link that takes the user away from the current website or journey by opening the destination in a new tab.

It's beneficial for users to know that a new tab will open as it helps prevent disorientation and/or frustration especially for users of assistive technology.

### Description

**Issue:** External link missing 'opens in a new tab' text

**Page:**

**URL:** 

**Description:** External links should contain text informing the user that they be taken to a new browser tab. This will help assistive technology users understand the result of the action and help prevent them getting disorientated when the browser back button is unavailable.

**Resolve:** Add ‘opens in new tab’ as part of the visible link which opens in the new tab. The text should be part of the link to make it easily identifiable for all users as well as being announced as part of the link for assistive technology users.
