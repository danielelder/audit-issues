## Audit template text

**Issue:** External link missing 'opens in a new tab' text

**Page:**

**URL:** 

**Description:** External links should contain text informing the user that they be taken to a new browser tab. This will help assistive technology users understand the result of the action and help prevent them getting disorientated when the browser back button is unavailable.

**Resolve:** Add " (opens in a new tab)" after the existing link text. The text should be part of the link to make it easily identifiable for all users as well as being announced as part of the link for assistive technology users.
